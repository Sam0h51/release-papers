Version 9.7.0 of deal.II, the object-oriented finite element library
awarded the J. H. Wilkinson Prize for Numerical Software and the
SIAM/ACM Prize in Computational Science and Engineering, has been
released. It is available for free under an Open Source license from
the deal.II homepage at

                   https://www.dealii.org/

The major changes of this release are:
  - Three new tutorial programs, showing how to deal with non-local degrees
    of freedom (step-93), matrix-free CutFEM methods (step-95), and curl-curl
    problems (step-97).
  - The introduction of an optimized MappingP1 class for affine mappings
    on simplex elements
  - Improved portability for matrix-free operations through the use of Kokkos
  - Task-based programming support is now based on the Taskflow library, in
    addition to the existing support via the Threading Building Blocks (TBB).
  - Many updates to external libraries, including to Kokkos, MUMPS, PSBLAS,
    Magic Enum, and ArborX, as well as to Trilinos' Tpetra stack.
  - deal.II can now build C++20-style modules.

The main features of deal.II are:
  - Extensive documentation and 88 working example programs
  - Support for dimension-independent programming
  - Locally refined adaptive meshes and multigrid support
  - A zoo of different finite elements
  - Built-in support for shared memory and distributed parallel
    computing, scaling from laptops to clusters with 300,000+ of
    processor cores
  - Interfaces to Trilinos, PETSc, SUNDIALS, UMFPACK and many other
    external software packages
  - Input and output for a wide variety of meshing and visualization
    platforms.
