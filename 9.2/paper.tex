\end{abstract}

\section{Overview}

\dealii version 9.2.0 was released May XYZ, 2020.
This paper provides an
overview of the new features of this release and serves as a citable
reference for the \dealii software library version 9.2. \dealii is an
object-oriented finite element library used around the world in the
development of finite element solvers. It is available for free under the
GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). Downloads are available at
\url{https://www.dealii.org/} and \url{https://github.com/dealii/dealii}.

The major changes of this release are:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item
%   \item Improved support for automatic differentiation (see
%     Section~\ref{subsec:ad}),
%   \item Dedicated support for symbolic algebra (see
%     Section~\ref{subsec:sd}),
%   \item Full support for $hp$~adaptivity in parallel computations (see
%     Section~\ref{subsec:hp}),
%   \item An interface to the HDF5 file format and libraries (see
%     Section~\ref{subsec:hdf5}),
%   \item Significantly extended GPU support (see Section~\ref{subsec:gpu}),
%   \item Parallel geometric multigrid (GMG) improvements (see
%     \cite{ClevengerHeisterKanschatKronbichler2019} and
%     Section~\ref{subsec:gmg}),
%   \item Four new tutorial programs (step-61, step-62, step-63, step-64),
%     as well as one new code gallery program (see
%     Section~\ref{subsec:steps}).
\end{itemize}
%
The major changes are discussed in detail in Section~\ref{sec:major}. There
are a number of other noteworthy changes in the current \dealii{} release
that we briefly outline in the remainder of this section:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item
% \item
%   The release contains a number of performance improvements and bug fixes for
%   the matrix-free framework. One notable improvement is the support for
%   renumbering of degrees of freedom within the cells for discontinuous
%   elements, avoiding some reshuffling operations across the SIMD lanes
%   with vectorization over several cells and faces, which is especially
%   useful on processors with AVX-512 vectorization (8 doubles), speeding up
%   operations by up to 10\%. Secondly, the strategy for the most efficient
%   tensor product evaluators according to the performance analysis of
%   \cite{KronbichlerKormann2019} in the context of more quadrature points than
%   shape functions has been revised for better performance.
%
% \item A new class \texttt{ParsedConvergenceTable} has been introduced
%   that greatly simplifies the construction of convergence tables,
%   reading the options for the generation of the table from a parameter
%   file, and providing methods that, combined with a parameter file,
%   allow one to generate convergence tables using one-liners in user
%   codes.
%
% \item
%   The \texttt{FE\_BernardiRaugel} class implements the non-standard
%   Bernardi-Raugel (BR) element that can be used to construct a stable
%   velocity-pressure pair for the Stokes equation \cite{BR85}. The BR
%   element is an enriched version of the $Q_1^d$ element with added bubble
%   functions on each edge (in 2d) or face (in 3d). It addresses the fact
%   that the $Q_1^d\times Q_0$ combination is not inf-sup stable (requiring a
%   larger velocity space), and that the $Q_2^d\times Q_0$ combination is
%   stable but converges with only first-order at the cost of the large
%   number of velocity unknowns. The BR space is thus intermediate between the
%   $Q_1^d$ and $Q_2^d$ spaces.
%
%   The element is currently only implemented for parallelogram meshes due to
%   difficulties associated with the mapping of shape functions: The shape
%   functions of the $Q_1^d$ part of the element need to be mapped as
%   scalars, as is common for the vector components of the $Q_1^d$ element;
%   on the other hand, the vector-valued edge bubble functions need to be
%   mapped using the Piola transform as is common for the Raviart-Thomas
%   element. \dealii{} does not currently have the ability to use different
%   mappings for individual shape functions, though this functionality is
%   planned for the next release.
%
% \item
%   The \texttt{FE\_NedelecSZ} class is a new implementation of the
%   N{\'e}d{\'e}lec element on quadrilaterals and hexahedra. It is based on
%   the work of Zaglmayr \cite{Zag06} and overcomes the sign conflict issues
%   present in traditional N{\'e}d{\'e}lec elements that arise from the edge
%   and face parameterizations used in the basis functions. Therefore, this
%   element should provide consistent results for general quadrilateral and
%   hexahedral elements for which the relative orientations of edges and
%   faces (as seen from all adjacent cells) are often difficult to establish.
%   The \texttt{FE\_NedelecSZ} element addresses the sign conflict problem by
%   assigning a globally defined orientation to local edges and faces. A
%   detailed overview of the implementation of the \texttt{FE\_NedelecSZ}
%   element in \dealii{} can be found in \cite{Kynch2017}.
%
% \item All of the elementary geometrical objects of the library (namely
%   \texttt{Point<dim>}, \texttt{Segment<dim>}, and
%   \texttt{BoundingBox<dim>}) have been augmented with the traits
%   needed to comply with \texttt{boost::geometry} concepts. A new
%   interface to \texttt{boost::geometry::index::rtree} has been added
%   that simplifies the construction of spatial indices based on points,
%   bounding boxes, or segments.
\end{itemize}
%
In addition to these changes, the changelog lists more than 200 other
features and bugfixes.

\section{Major changes to the library}
\label{sec:major}

This release of \dealii contains a number of large and significant changes
that will be discussed in this section.

It of course also contains a
vast number of smaller changes and added functionality; the details of these
can be found
\href{https://dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/changes_between_9_0_1_and_9_1_0.html}{
in the file that lists all changes for this release}, see \cite{changes91}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{bla1}
\label{subsec:bla1}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{New and improved tutorial and code gallery programs}
\label{subsec:steps}

Many of the \dealii{} tutorial programs were substantially revised as
part of this release. In particular, we have converted many places
that now allow for simpler code through the use of C++11 features such
as range-based for loops and lambda functions.

In addition, there are seven new tutorial programs:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{step-47}
\item \texttt{step-50}
\item \texttt{step-58}
\item \texttt{step-65}
\item \texttt{step-67}
\item \texttt{step-69}
\item \texttt{step-70}
\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Incompatible changes}

The 9.2 release includes
\href{https://dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/changes_between_9_1_1_and_9_2_0.html}
     {around 15 incompatible changes}; see \cite{changes92}. The majority of these changes
should not be visible to typical user codes; some remove previously
deprecated classes and functions; and the majority change internal
interfaces that are not usually used in external
applications. However, some are worth mentioning:
\begin{itemize}
\item
% \item The \texttt{VectorView} class was removed. We recommend either copying the
%       vector subset into a \texttt{Vector} or using a \texttt{BlockVector}.
% \item The function \texttt{Subscriptor::subscribe()}, used through the
%   \texttt{SmartPointer} class, now requires a pointer to a
%       \texttt{std::atomic<bool>} that tracks whether or not the pointer to the
%       subscribed-to object is still valid.
% \item The \texttt{ConstraintMatrix} class gained a template parameter for the scalar
%       type and was been renamed \texttt{AffineConstraints}. Several methods that
%       take vectors or matrices as arguments,
%       such as \texttt{AffineConstraints::distribute\_local\_to\_global()},
%       now require that all matrix and vector arguments have matching number
%       types.
% \item Similarly, the functions \texttt{create\_mass\_matrix} and
%       \texttt{create\_boundary\_mass\_matrix} in the \texttt{MatrixCreator}
%       namespace no longer
%       support matrix and vector objects of different types.
\end{itemize}

\section{How to cite \dealii}\label{sec:cite}

In order to justify the work the developers of \dealii put into this
software, we ask that papers using the library reference one of the
\dealii papers. This helps us justify the effort we put into it.

There are various ways to reference \dealii. To acknowledge the use of
the current version of the library, \textbf{please reference the present
document}. For up to date information and a bibtex entry for this document
