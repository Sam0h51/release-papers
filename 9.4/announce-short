Version 9.4.0 of deal.II, the object-oriented finite element library awarded
the J. H. Wilkinson Prize for Numerical Software, has been released. It is
available for free under an Open Source license from the deal.II homepage at
https://www.dealii.org/

The major changes of this release are:

 - Advances in simplex- and mixed-mesh support
 - Repartitioning of distributed meshes
 - Advances in matrix-free infrastructure
 - Advances in multigrid infrastructure
 - CutFEM support
 - Experimental integration of the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (CGAL)
 - Performance improvements in the particle infrastructure
 - Improvements to unstructured communication
 - Three new tutorial programs (steps 81, 82, and 85) and one new code gallery program

The main features of deal.II are:
  - Extensive documentation and 83 working example programs
  - Support for dimension-independent programming
  - Locally refined adaptive meshes and multigrid support
  - A zoo of different finite elements
  - Built-in support for shared memory and distributed parallel computing,
    scaling from laptops to clusters with 100,000+ of processor cores
  - Interfaces to Trilinos, PETSc, METIS, UMFPACK and other external software
