Version 9.5.0 of deal.II, the object-oriented finite element library awarded
the J. H. Wilkinson Prize for Numerical Software, has been released. It is
available for free under an Open Source license from the deal.II homepage at
https://www.dealii.org/

The major changes of this release are:
  - Substantial updates and extensions to deal.II's interfaces to other
    libraries. This includes, in particular, the integration of Kokkos
    additions and updates to the PETSc and Trilinos interfaces.
  - Uniform handling of nonlinear solver packages and a uniform way of
    defining callbacks used by external libraries.
  - Advances in matrix-free infrastructure.
  - Advances in non-matching support.
  - New features related to linear algebra.
  - C++ language modernization.
  - Build-system modernization.

The main features of deal.II are:
  - Extensive documentation and 83 working example programs
  - Support for dimension-independent programming
  - Locally refined adaptive meshes and multigrid support
  - A zoo of different finite elements
  - Built-in support for shared memory and distributed parallel computing,
    scaling from laptops to clusters with 100,000+ of processor cores
  - Interfaces to Trilinos, PETSc, METIS, UMFPACK and other external software
