Version 9.3.0 of deal.II, the object-oriented finite element library
awarded the J. H. Wilkinson Prize for Numerical Software, has been
released. It is available for free under an Open Source license from
the deal.II homepage at https://www.dealii.org/

The major changes of this release are:
- Ten new tutorial programs covering: particle methods, tracking
  locations in a flow field, a matrix-free geometric multigrid solver
  for a nonlinear problem, automatic and symbolic differentiation,
  SUNDIALS interfaces for nonlinear problems, SIPG approach to
  discontinuous Galerkin methods, an explicit integrator for the
  Euler equations, a solver for the Black-Scholes equations, and
  topology optimization problems.
- Experimental support for simplex and mixed meshes.
- Improved flexibility of the particle infrastructure.
- Support for global-coarsening multigrid algorithms.
- Advances in the matrix-free infrastructure.
- Usage of MPI-3.0 shared-memory features to reduce memory footprint
- Improved support for evaluation and integration at arbitrary points
- More than 210 other new features, improvements, and bugfixes.
For more information see the preprint at https://www.dealii.org/deal93-preprint.pdf

The main features of deal.II are:
- Extensive documentation and 76 fully-functional example programs
- Support for dimension-independent programming
- Locally refined adaptive meshes with multigrid support
- A zoo of different finite elements and fast linear algebra
- Built-in support for shared memory and distributed parallel computing,
- Interfaces to Trilinos, PETSc, METIS, UMFPACK and other external software
- Output for a wide variety of visualization platforms.
