  This paper provides an overview of the new features of the finite element
  library \dealii, version 9.5.

\section{Overview}

\dealii version 9.5.0 was released XX XX, 2023.
This paper provides an
overview of the new features of this release and serves as a citable
reference for the \dealii software library version 9.5. \dealii is an
object-oriented finite element library used around the world in the
development of finite element solvers. It is available for free under the
GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). Downloads are available at
\url{https://www.dealii.org/} and \url{https://github.com/dealii/dealii}.

The major changes of this release are:
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item Integration of \texttt{Kokkos} (see Section~\ref{sec:kokkos});
  \item Update of the \texttt{PETSc} infrastructure (see Section~\ref{sec:petsc});
  \item Addition of new \texttt{Trilinos} wrappers (see Section~\ref{sec:trilinos});
  \item Advances in matrix-free infrastructure (see Section~\ref{sec:mf});
  \item Advance in non-matching support (see Section~\ref{sec:nonmatching});
  \item New liner algebra features (see Section~\ref{sec:lac}).
\end{itemize}
%

While all of these major changes are discussed in detail in
Section~\ref{sec:major}, there
are a number of other noteworthy changes in the current \dealii release,
which we briefly outline in the remainder of this section:
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item The \texttt{CellAccessor::as\_dof\_handler\_iterator()}
\end{itemize}
%
The changelog lists more than X other features and bugfixes.

\section{Major changes to the library}
\label{sec:major}

This release of \dealii contains a number of large and significant changes,
which will be discussed in this section.
It of course also includes a
vast number of smaller changes and added functionality; the details of these
can be found
\href{https://dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/changes_between_9_4_2_and_9_5_0.html}
{in the file that lists all changes for this release}; see \cite{changes95}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{New Trilinos wrappers}\label{sec:trilinos}

\begin{itemize}
\item Belos
\item NOX
\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Advances in matrix-free infrastructure}\label{sec:mf}

\begin{itemize}
\item element activation and deactivation, \texttt{FE\_Nothing}, categorization, DG, face integrals 
\item pre/post for DG
\item \texttt{CellwiseInverseMassMatrix} operator for coupling (dyadic) coefficients
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Advance in non-matching support}\label{sec:nonmatching}






%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{New linear algebra features}\label{sec:lac}



\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{SolverGMRES}: classical/modified Gram Schmidt process
  \item James Lottesâ€™s fourth-kind Chebyshev
  \item \texttt{PreconditionChebyshev}, \texttt{PreconditionRelaxation}
  \item restrict matrices
  \item fast diagonalization method
\end{itemize}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{New and improved tutorials and code gallery programs}
\label{subsec:steps}

Many of the \dealii tutorial programs were revised in a variety of ways
as part of this release. In addition, there are a number of new tutorial
programs:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
\end{itemize}

There is also a new program in the code gallery (a collection of
user-contributed programs that often solve more complicated problems
than tutorial programs, and that are intended as starting points for further
research rather than as teaching tools):
\begin{itemize}
  \item 
\end{itemize}
Finally, 



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Incompatible changes}\label{subsec:deprecated}

The 9.5 release includes
\href{https://dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/changes_between_9_4_2_and_9_5_0.html}
{around X incompatible changes}; see \cite{changes95}. The majority of these changes
should not be visible to typical user codes; some remove previously
deprecated classes and functions; and the majority changes internal
interfaces that are not usually used in external
applications. That said, the following are worth mentioning since they
may have been more widely used:
\begin{itemize}
  \item 
\end{itemize}

\section{How to cite \dealii}\label{sec:cite}

In order to justify the work the developers of \dealii put into this
software, we ask that papers using the library reference one of the
\dealii papers. This helps us justify the effort we put into this library.

There are various ways to reference \dealii. To acknowledge the use of
the current version of the library, \textbf{please reference the present
  document}. For up-to-date information and a bibtex entry
see
\begin{center}
  \url{https://www.dealii.org/publications.html}
\end{center}

The original \dealii paper containing an overview of its
architecture is \cite{BangerthHartmannKanschat2007}, and a more recent
publication documenting \dealii's design decisions is available as \cite{dealII2020design}. If you rely on
specific features of the library, please consider citing any of the
