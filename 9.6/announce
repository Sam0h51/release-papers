Version 9.6.0 of deal.II, the object-oriented finite element library awarded the
J. H. Wilkinson Prize for Numerical Software, has been released. It is
available for free under an Open Source license from the deal.II homepage at

                   https://www.dealii.org/

The major changes of this release are:
  - There are six new tutorial programs, on checkpointing simulations
    (step-83), integrating time-dependent solvers with external time
    stepping libraries (step-86, using PETSc's TS library), advanced
    point evaluation techniques (step-87), non-matching grids
    (step-89), and trace-based methods for PDEs on embedded surfaces
    (step-90).  
  - Much work has gone into writing wrappers for Trilinos' Tpetra
    stack of linear algebra classes. Tpetra is Trilinos' Kokkos-based
    replacement for the now-deprecated Epetra stack. While many things
    already work with the Tpetra wrappers, not everything that is
    currently available with the Epetra wrappers is implemented with
    the Tpetra wrappers at this point.
  - Substantial improvements to the multigrid two-level transfer
    operators, including matrix-free based versions and versions for
    p-refinement.
  - Strategies for better refinement of tetrahedra.
  - Support for hanging nodes in the Nedelec-SZ implementation.
  - Cubic simplex elements.
  - Better and delayed orthogonalization strategies for the GMRES and
    F-GMRES implementations.
  - A class FERemoteEvaluation that provides support for evaluating
    finite element shape functions and solutions on parts of the
    domain stored by other MPI processes.
  - Tool classes TaskResult and Lazy that provide ways to compute
    values on a separate thread or only when first accessed.
  - deal.II now requires and uses of C++17.

The main features of deal.II are:
  - Extensive documentation and 89 working example programs
  - Support for dimension-independent programming
  - Locally refined adaptive meshes and multigrid support
  - A zoo of different finite elements
  - Built-in support for shared memory and distributed parallel computing,
    scaling from laptops to clusters with 300,000+ of processor cores
  - Interfaces to Trilinos, PETSc, SUNDIALS, UMFPACK and many other external
    software packages
  - Input and output for a wide variety of meshing and visualization platforms.
