Version 9.6.0 of deal.II, the object-oriented finite element library awarded the
J. H. Wilkinson Prize for Numerical Software, has been released. It is
available for free under an Open Source license from the deal.II homepage at

                   https://www.dealii.org/

The major changes of this release are:
  - Much work has gone into writing wrappers for Trilinos' Tpetra
    stack of linear algebra classes. Tpetra is Trilinos' Kokkos-based
    replacement for the now-deprecated Epetra stack. While many things
    already work with the Tpetra wrappers, not everything that is
    currently available with the Epetra wrappers is implemented with
    the Tpetra wrappers at this point.
  - Better tet refinement
  - Support for hanging nodes in Nedelec-SZ
  - FERemoteEvaluation
  - Cubic simplex elements
  - New tutorials, new code gallery programs
