Version 9.6.0 of deal.II, the object-oriented finite element library awarded
the J. H. Wilkinson Prize for Numerical Software, has been released. It is
available for free under an Open Source license from the deal.II homepage at
https://www.dealii.org/

The major changes of this release are:
  - Six new tutorial programs.  
  - Much work on wrappers for Trilinos' Tpetra stack of linear algebra classes.
  - Improvements to the multigrid two-level transfer operators.
  - Better orthogonalization strategies for the GMRES and F-GMRES implementations.
  - deal.II now requires and uses of C++17.

More information about changes can be found in the release preprint at
https://www.dealii.org/deal96-preprint.pdf.

The main features of deal.II are:
  - Extensive documentation and 89 working example programs
  - Support for dimension-independent programming
  - Locally refined adaptive meshes and multigrid support
  - A zoo of different finite elements
  - Built-in support for shared memory and distributed parallel computing,
    scaling from laptops to clusters with 300,000+ of processor cores
  - Interfaces to Trilinos, PETSc, SUNDIALS, UMFPACK and many other external
    software packages
  - Input and output for a wide variety of meshing and visualization platforms.
