Version 9.5.0 of deal.II, the object-oriented finite element library awarded
the J. H. Wilkinson Prize for Numerical Software, has been released. It is
available for free under an Open Source license from the deal.II homepage at
https://www.dealii.org/

The major changes of this release are:
  - Substantial updates and extensions to deal.II's interfaces to other
    libraries. This includes, in particular, the integration of Kokkos
    additions and updates to the PETSc and Trilinos interfaces.
  - Improvements to the matrix-free infrastructure
  - Better support for non-matching grids
  - Faster or more robust linear solvers and preconditioners
  - Many changes to the CMake configuration system, as well as more extensive
    use of modern C++ features
  - A large number of updates to the tutorials and other documentation.

More information about changes can be found in the release preprint at
https://www.dealii.org/deal95-preprint.pdf.

The main features of deal.II are:
  - Extensive documentation and 83 working example programs
  - Support for dimension-independent programming
  - Locally refined adaptive meshes and multigrid support
  - A zoo of different finite elements
  - Built-in support for shared memory and distributed parallel computing,
    scaling from laptops to clusters with 100,000+ of processor cores
  - Interfaces to Trilinos, PETSc, SUNDIALS, UMFPACK and many other external
    software packages
  - Input and output for a wide variety of meshing and visualization platforms.
