\begin{abstract}
  This paper provides an overview of the new features of the finite element
  library \dealii, version 9.6.
\end{abstract}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Overview}

\dealii version 9.6.0 was released X X, 2024.
This paper provides an
overview of the new features of this release and serves as a citable
reference for the \dealii software library version 9.6. \dealii is an
object-oriented finite element library used around the world in the
development of finite element solvers. It is available for free under the
GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). Downloads are available at
\url{https://www.dealii.org/} and \url{https://github.com/dealii/dealii}.

The major changes of this release are:
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item 
\end{itemize}
%

While all of these major changes are discussed in detail in
Section~\ref{sec:major}, there
are a number of other noteworthy changes in the current \dealii release,
which we briefly outline in the remainder of this section:
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item changes of interface of AffineConstraints
  \item clean up: orientation
\end{itemize}
%
The changelog lists more than X other features and bugfixes.

\section{Major changes to the library}
\label{sec:major}

This release of \dealii contains a number of large and significant changes,
which will be discussed in this section.
It of course also includes a
vast number of smaller changes and added functionality; the details of these
can be found
\href{https://dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/changes_between_9_4_2_and_9_5_0.html}
{in the file that lists all changes for this release}; see \cite{changes95}.


\begin{itemize}
\item Hermite element
\item simplices: cubic simplex elements, improved refinement of tetrahedron cells
\item Tpetra advances
\item Nedelec for meshes with hanging nodes
\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Updates to matrix-free algorithms}\label{sec:mf}

\begin{itemize}
\item VectorizedArray for ARM Neon
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Advances in non-matching support}\label{sec:nonmatching}

\begin{itemize}
\item non-nested multigrid: new features and performance improvement
\item FERemoteEvaluation
\item FEColungValues
\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{New and improved tutorials and code gallery programs}
\label{subsec:steps}

Many of the \dealii tutorial programs were revised in a variety of ways
as part of this release. In addition, there are a number of new tutorial
programs:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    \texttt{step-87} was contributed by Magdalena Schreter-Fleischhacker
    (Technical University of Munich) and Peter Munch
    (University of Augsburg/Uppsala University). It
    presents the advanced point-evaluation functionalities of \dealii,
    specifically useful for evaluating finite element solutions at
    arbitrary points on finite element meshes that can be distributed among processes.
  \item
    \texttt{step-89} was contributed by Johannes Heinz (TU Wien),
    Maximilian Bergbauer (Technical University of Munich),
    Marco Feder (SISSA), and Peter Munch (University of Augsburg/Uppsala University).
    It shows one way how to apply non-matching and/or Chimera methods
    within matrix-free loops in \dealii.
  \item
    \texttt{step-90} was contributed by Vladimir Yushutin and Timo Heister (Clemson University).
    It implements the trace finite element method (TraceFEM). TraceFEM solves PDEs
    posed on a possibly evolving $(dim-1)$-dimensional surface $\Gamma$ employing
    a fixed uniform background mesh of a $dim$-dimensional domain in which
    the surface is embedded. Such surface PDEs arise in problems involving
    material films with complex properties and in other situations in which
    a non-trivial condition is imposed on either a stationary or a moving interface.
    Here we consider a steady, complex, non-trivial surface and the prototypical
    Laplace-Beltrami equation which is a counterpart of
    the Poisson problem on flat domains.
\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Incompatible changes}\label{subsec:deprecated}

The 9.6 release includes
\href{https://dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/changes_between_9_5_2_and_9_6_0.html}
     {around X incompatible changes};
see \cite{changes96}. Many of these
incompatibilities change internal
interfaces that are not usually used in external
applications. That said, the following are worth mentioning since they
may have been more widely used:
\begin{itemize}
  \item CUDAWrappers
\end{itemize}

\section{How to cite \dealii}\label{sec:cite}

In order to justify the work the developers of \dealii put into this
software, we ask that papers using the library reference one of the
\dealii papers. This helps us justify the effort we put into this library.

There are various ways to reference \dealii. To acknowledge the use of
the current version of the library, \textbf{please reference the present
  document}. For up-to-date information and a bibtex entry
see
\begin{center}
  \url{https://www.dealii.org/publications.html}
\end{center}

The original \dealii paper containing an overview of its
architecture is \cite{BangerthHartmannKanschat2007}, and a more recent
publication documenting \dealii's design decisions is available as \cite{dealII2020design}. If you rely on
specific features of the library, please consider citing any of the
