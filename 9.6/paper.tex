\begin{abstract}
  This paper provides an overview of the new features of the finite element
  library \dealii, version 9.6.
\end{abstract}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Overview}

\dealii version 9.6.0 was released X X, 2024.
This paper provides an
overview of the new features of this release and serves as a citable
reference for the \dealii software library version 9.6. \dealii is an
object-oriented finite element library used around the world in the
development of finite element solvers. It is available for free under the
GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). Downloads are available at
\url{https://www.dealii.org/} and \url{https://github.com/dealii/dealii}.

The major changes of this release are:
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item 
\end{itemize}
%

While all of these major changes are discussed in detail in
Section~\ref{sec:major}, there
are a number of other noteworthy changes in the current \dealii release,
which we briefly outline in the remainder of this section:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item changes of interface of AffineConstraints
\item clean up: orientation
\item various performance improvements throughout the library
\item the \texttt{SolverGMRES} class now offers a third orthogonalization
  method, the classical Gram--Schmidt method with delayed orthogonalization
  \cite{Bielich2022}. Furthermore, the solver now specifies the maximal basis
  size of the Arnoldi basis, rather than the number of auxiliary vectors.
\end{itemize}
%
The changelog lists more than X other features and bugfixes.

\section{Major changes to the library}
\label{sec:major}

This release of \dealii contains a number of large and significant changes,
which will be discussed in this section.
It of course also includes a
vast number of smaller changes and added functionality; the details of these
can be found
\href{https://dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/changes_between_9_4_2_and_9_5_0.html}
{in the file that lists all changes for this release}; see \cite{changes95}.


\begin{itemize}
\item Hermite element
\item simplices: cubic simplex elements, improved refinement of tetrahedron cells
\item Tpetra advances
\item Nedelec for meshes with hanging nodes
\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Relicensing to Apache 2.0}\label{sec:license}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Updates to matrix-free algorithms}\label{sec:mf}

\begin{itemize}
\item VectorizedArray for ARM Neon
\item Improvement for evaluation of values and gradients for
  $H$(div)-conforming Raviart--Thomas elements on non-Cartesian elements
\item Improved internal data structures of the tensor-product evaluators as
  well as the evaluators for simplex elements, which speed up the evaluation
  in several scenarios, especially multi-component systems.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Advances in non-matching support}\label{sec:nonmatching}

\begin{itemize}
\item non-nested multigrid: new features and performance improvement
\item FERemoteEvaluation
\item FECouplingValues
\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{New and improved tutorials and code gallery programs}
\label{subsec:steps}

Many of the \dealii tutorial programs were revised in a variety of ways
as part of this release. In addition, there are a number of new tutorial
programs:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    \texttt{step-83} 
    demonstrates how one can implement
    checkpoint/restart functionality in \dealii{}-based programs,
    using the BOOST serialization functionality as a
    foundation. step-83 was written by Pasquale Africa, Wolfgang
    Bangerth, and Bruno Blais and uses step-19 as its basis.
  \item
    \texttt{step-86}
    is a program that solves the heat equation using PETSc's TS (time
    stepping) framework for the solution of ordinary differential
    equations. Written by Wolfgang Bangerth (Colorado State
    University), Luca Heltai (University of Pisa), and Stefano Zampini
    (King Abdullah University of Science and Technology), it
    illustrates how PDE solvers for time-dependent problems can be
    integrated with existing ODE solver packages to use advanced ODE
    solver concepts (such as higher-order time integration methods and
    adaptive time step control), all without sacrificing the things
    that have traditionally led code authors toward writing their own
    time stepping routines (such as wanting to change the mesh every
    once in a while, or having to deal with boundary conditions).
  \item
    \texttt{step-87} was contributed by Magdalena Schreter-Fleischhacker
    (Technical University of Munich) and Peter Munch
    (University of Augsburg/Uppsala University). It
    presents the advanced point-evaluation functionalities of \dealii
    that are useful for evaluating finite element solutions at
    arbitrary points on finite element meshes that can be distributed among processes.
  \item
    \texttt{step-89} was contributed by Johannes Heinz (TU Wien),
    Maximilian Bergbauer (Technical University of Munich),
    Marco Feder (SISSA), and Peter Munch (University of Augsburg/Uppsala University).
    It shows one way how to apply non-matching and/or Chimera methods
    within matrix-free loops in \dealii.
  \item
    \texttt{step-90} was contributed by Vladimir Yushutin and Timo Heister (Clemson University).
    It implements the trace finite element method (TraceFEM). TraceFEM solves PDEs
    posed on a, possibly evolving, $(dim-1)$-dimensional surface $\Gamma$ employing
    a fixed uniform background mesh of a $dim$-dimensional domain in which
    the surface is embedded. Such surface PDEs arise in problems involving
    material films with complex properties and in other situations in which
    a non-trivial condition is imposed on either a stationary or a moving interface.
    The program considers a steady, complex, non-trivial surface and the prototypical
    Laplace-Beltrami equation which is a counterpart of
    the Poisson problem on flat domains.
\end{itemize}

In addition, there are three new programs in the code gallery (a collection of
user-contributed programs that often solve more complicated problems
than tutorial programs, and that are intended as starting points for further
research rather than as teaching tools):
UPDATE
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{``Crystal growth phase field model'''},
    contributed by Umair Hussain;
  \item \textit{``Nonlinear heat transfer problem''}, contributed by
    Narasimhan Swaminathan;
  \item \textit{``Traveling-wave solutions of a qualitative model for combustion waves''}, contributed by
    Shamil Magomedov.
\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Incompatible changes}\label{subsec:deprecated}

The 9.6 release includes
\href{https://dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/changes_between_9_5_2_and_9_6_0.html}
     {around X incompatible changes};
see \cite{changes96}. Many of these
incompatibilities change internal
interfaces that are not usually used in external
applications. That said, the following are worth mentioning since they
may have been more widely used:
\begin{itemize}
  \item CUDAWrappers
\end{itemize}
