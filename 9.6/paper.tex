\begin{abstract}
  This paper provides an overview of the new features of the finite element
  library \dealii, version 9.6.
\end{abstract}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Overview}

\dealii version 9.6.0 was released August 11, 2024.
This paper provides an
overview of the new features of this release and serves as a citable
reference for the \dealii software library version 9.6. \dealii is an
object-oriented finite element library used around the world in the
development of finite element solvers. It is available for free under the
GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). Downloads are available at
\url{https://www.dealii.org/} and \url{https://github.com/dealii/dealii}.

The major changes of this release are:
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item Substantial improvements to the multigrid two-level transfer
    operators, including matrix-free based versions and versions for
    p-refinement (Section~\ref{sec:mf}).
  \item A class FERemoteEvaluation that provides support for evaluating
    finite element shape functions and solutions on parts of the
    domain stored by other MPI processes (Section~\ref{sec:remote-eval}).
  \item Much work has gone into writing wrappers for Trilinos' Tpetra
    stack of linear algebra classes. Tpetra is Trilinos' Kokkos-based
    replacement for the now-deprecated Epetra stack. See
    Section~\ref{sec:tpetra} for more on this.
  \item Tool classes \texttt{TaskResult} and \texttt{Lazy} that provide ways to compute
    values on a separate thread or only when first accessed (Section~\ref{sec:tools}).
  \item There are six new tutorial programs, on checkpointing simulations
    (step-83), integrating time-dependent solvers with external time
    stepping libraries (step-86, using PETSc's TS library), advanced
    point evaluation techniques (step-87), non-matching grids
    (step-89), and trace-based methods for PDEs on embedded surfaces
    (step-90). See Section~\ref{subsec:steps} for more details.
\end{itemize}
%

\todo[inline]{If we keep the section on relicensing
  (Section~\ref{sec:license}), mention it in the list above.}

While all of these major changes are discussed in detail in
Section~\ref{sec:major}, there
are a number of other noteworthy changes in the current \dealii release,
which we briefly outline in the remainder of this section:
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item deal.II now requires and uses of C++17.
  \item We have continued to make progress in supporting simplex and
    mixed meshes -- mesh types that \dealii{} has traditionally not
    supported at all. Specifically, the current release uses
    better strategies for refinement of tetrahedra that result in
    better-shaped child cells. It also contains
    support for cubic finite elements on simplices.
  \item The \texttt{FE\_NedelecSZ} class that contains our
    implementation of the N\'ed\'elec element using the orientation
    scheme of \cite{Zag06} now supports the computation of hanging
    node constraints for locally refined meshes.
    \todo[inline]{Sebastian: Is there anything more to say here? If
      you want, we can also list this point in the list above, and add
      a whole section 2.x for it.}
  \item changes of interface of AffineConstraints
    \todo[inline]{Wolfgang to write}
\item clean up: orientation
  \todo[inline]{DavidW: Please describe some details here.}
\item Various performance improvements throughout the library.
  \todo[inline]{Everyone: This sentence would be more useful if we can
    provide a few examples.}
\item The \texttt{SolverGMRES} class now offers a third orthogonalization
  method, the classical Gram--Schmidt method with delayed orthogonalization
  \cite{Bielich2022}. Furthermore, the solver now specifies the maximal basis
  size of the Arnoldi basis, rather than the number of auxiliary
  vectors. Some changes have also been made to the GMRES and F-GMRES
  implementations to make them more similar.
  \todo[inline]{Martin: Does this capture the relevant changes? Please
    fix as appropriate, or if you'd like put them into a section of
    its own.}
\end{itemize}
%
The changelog lists more than 180 other features and bugfixes.

\section{Major changes to the library}
\label{sec:major}

This release of \dealii contains a number of large and significant changes,
which we will discuss in this section.
It of course also includes a
vast number of smaller changes and added functionality; the details of these
can be found
\href{https://dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/changes_between_9_5_2_and_9_6_0.html}
{in the file that lists all changes for this release}; see \cite{changes96}.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Updates to multigrid and matrix-free algorithms}\label{sec:mf}

\todo[inline]{Martin/Peter: The list in the introduction also mentions the two-level
  operators. Is this the right place to also discuss these?}

\begin{itemize}
\item VectorizedArray for ARM Neon
\item Improvement for evaluation of values and gradients for
  $H$(div)-conforming Raviart--Thomas elements on non-Cartesian elements
\item Improved internal data structures of the tensor-product evaluators as
  well as the evaluators for simplex elements, which speed up the evaluation
  in several scenarios, especially multi-component systems.
\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{The \texttt{FERemoteEvaluation} class}\label{sec:remote-eval}

\todo[inline]{Peter/Martin/...: Would you be willing to describe this
  class and its uses? Or, if you don't think it's important enough,
  remove this section and move the part in the top list of major
  changes to the bottom list?}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Advances in non-matching support}\label{sec:nonmatching}

\todo[inline]{All: If you contributed to this functionality, please
  help flesh out this section.}

\begin{itemize}
\item non-nested multigrid: new features and performance improvement
\item FERemoteEvaluation
\item FECouplingValues
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Interface to the \trilinos{} \tpetra stack}\label{sec:tpetra}

\dealii{}'s parallel linear algebra facilities are largely built on
wrappers around functionality provided by the \petsc{} and \trilinos{} libraries.
As a software project, \trilinos{} is designed as a stack of semi-independent
packages building upon each other and working together. 
As a foundation, \teuchos{} offers a set of basic tools,
including parameter handling through XML files or command line interfaces 
and the reference counted pointer \texttt{RCP} which predates 
the smart pointer types introduced in \texttt{C++11}.
The second layer in the stack is a package providing distributed linear algebra 
classes for vectors and (sparse) matrices based on the \petra{}
object model. The third layer is a set of interconnected packages
providing preconditioners, various types of solvers 
as well as more advanced techniques like automatic differentiation, 
time integration and discretization.

Historically, \trilinos{} has implemented \petra{} objects -- such as
parallel vector, sparsity pattern, and sparse matrix classes -- in its
\epetra{} package that uses \MPI{} as its only source of
parallelism. The \dealii{} interfaces to \trilinos{} are therefore all
built using \epetra{}.
However, several years ago, \trilinos also introduced the
newer \tpetra{} (``templated'' Petra) package that provides additional shared memory 
parallelism and GPU capabilities by building on \kokkos{}. \tpetra{}
is slated to eventually replace \epetra{}, and the latter is indeed
now deprecated with removal slated for 2025. As a consequence, we will
eventually have to switch all of our \trilinos{} interfaces to
\tpetra{}; the same is true for the need to switch to \tpetra{}-based
sub-packages replacing existing \trilinos sub-packages (for example,
Ifpack2 instead of Ifpack).

In the current release, we have put substantial work into this switch.

\todo[inline]{Sebastian \& Jan Philipp: Please complete}


\begin{itemize}
  \item Short overview capabilities of \epetra (MPI parallel, fixed types) [Thiele]
  \item Short overview capabilities of \tpetra (MPI+X via Kokkos, auto diff types, Templated petra) [Thiele]
    \todo[inline]{Keep discussion of the two items above as short as
      you can -- we're describing the changes in deal.II, not some
      other package. Perhaps roll what you want to say into the
      paragraphs above?}
  \item Current state of the interface (Tpetra based linear algebra, direct solver from Amesos2, preconditioners from Ifpack2) [Thiele \& Kinnewig]
  \item User relevant changes from \epetra: incompatibilities, removed
    options, changes in the constructor. [Thiele \& Kinnewig]
    \todo[inline]{These last two items are the important ones.}
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{More support for advanced programming idioms}\label{sec:tools}

\todo[inline]{Wolfgang to write. Mention Lazy and TaskResult.}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{New and improved tutorials and code gallery programs}
\label{subsec:steps}

Many of the \dealii tutorial programs were revised in a variety of ways
as part of this release. In addition, there are a number of new tutorial
programs:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    \texttt{step-83} 
    demonstrates how one can implement
    checkpoint/restart functionality in \dealii{}-based programs,
    using the BOOST serialization functionality as a
    foundation. step-83 was written by Pasquale Africa, Wolfgang
    Bangerth, and Bruno Blais and uses step-19 as its basis.
  \item
    \texttt{step-86}
    is a program that solves the heat equation using PETSc's TS (time
    stepping) framework for the solution of ordinary differential
    equations. Written by Wolfgang Bangerth (Colorado State
    University), Luca Heltai (University of Pisa), and Stefano Zampini
    (King Abdullah University of Science and Technology), it
    illustrates how PDE solvers for time-dependent problems can be
    integrated with existing ODE solver packages to use advanced ODE
    solver concepts (such as higher-order time integration methods and
    adaptive time step control), all without sacrificing the things
    that have traditionally led code authors toward writing their own
    time stepping routines (such as wanting to change the mesh every
    once in a while, or having to deal with boundary conditions).
  \item
    \texttt{step-87} was contributed by Magdalena Schreter-Fleischhacker
    (Technical University of Munich) and Peter Munch
    (University of Augsburg/Uppsala University). It
    presents the advanced point-evaluation functionalities of \dealii
    that are useful for evaluating finite element solutions at
    arbitrary points on finite element meshes that can be distributed among processes.
  \item
    \texttt{step-89} was contributed by Johannes Heinz (TU Wien),
    Maximilian Bergbauer (Technical University of Munich),
    Marco Feder (SISSA), and Peter Munch (University of Augsburg/Uppsala University).
    It shows one way how to apply non-matching and/or Chimera methods
    within matrix-free loops in \dealii.
  \item
    \texttt{step-90} was contributed by Vladimir Yushutin and Timo Heister (Clemson University).
    It implements the trace finite element method (TraceFEM). TraceFEM solves PDEs
    posed on a, possibly evolving, $(dim-1)$-dimensional surface $\Gamma$ employing
    a fixed uniform background mesh of a $dim$-dimensional domain in which
    the surface is embedded. Such surface PDEs arise in problems involving
    material films with complex properties and in other situations in which
    a non-trivial condition is imposed on either a stationary or a moving interface.
    The program considers a steady, complex, non-trivial surface and the prototypical
    Laplace-Beltrami equation which is a counterpart of
    the Poisson problem on flat domains.
\end{itemize}

In addition, there are three new programs in the code gallery (a collection of
user-contributed programs that often solve more complicated problems
than tutorial programs, and that are intended as starting points for further
research rather than as teaching tools):
UPDATE
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{``Crystal growth phase field model'''},
    contributed by Umair Hussain;
  \item \textit{``Nonlinear heat transfer problem''}, contributed by
    Narasimhan Swaminathan;
  \item \textit{``Traveling-wave solutions of a qualitative model for combustion waves''}, contributed by
    Shamil Magomedov.
\end{itemize}

Furthermore, we added an example to the \texttt{libCEED}
library.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/CEED/libCEED}} \texttt{libCEED} is a library
that provides matrix-free evaluation routines that work on different hardware. The
examples show how to interface the \dealii data structures to the \texttt{libCEED} ones.
The example solves the BP1-BP6 benchmarks (scalar/vector Laplace/mass matrix with
regular integration and over-integration).


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Relicensing to Apache 2.0}\label{sec:license}

\todo[inline]{Matthias: Where are we with this, and what of it is
  worth describing here?}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Incompatible changes}\label{subsec:deprecated}

The 9.6 release includes
\href{https://dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/changes_between_9_5_2_and_9_6_0.html}
     {around 40 incompatible changes};
see \cite{changes96}. Many of these
incompatibilities change internal
interfaces that are not usually used in external
applications. That said, the following are worth mentioning since they
may have been more widely used:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \dealii{} now requires compilers to support C++17, and has
    started to extensively use C++17 features.
  \item The \texttt{CUDAWrappers} namespace and its contents --
    notably things that enable the usage of cuSPARSE algorithms --
    have been deprecated and will be removed in the next
    release. Kokkos is now used for device-specific optimizations.
\end{itemize}
