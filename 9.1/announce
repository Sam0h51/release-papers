Version 9.1.0 of deal.II, the object-oriented finite element library awarded the
J. H. Wilkinson Prize for Numerical Software, has been released. It is
available for free under an Open Source license from the deal.II homepage at

                   https://www.dealii.org/

The major changes of this release are:

  - Improved support for automatic and symbolic differentiation

    EXPAND

  - Full support for hp adaptivity in parallel computations. deal.II has
    had support for hp-adaptive methods since around 2005, but not for both
    at the same time. In order to gain support for parallel hp adaptivity a
    number of algorithmic issues were addressed in this release. Details
    can be found in the release paper.

  - Interfaces to the HDF5 file format and libraries

    EXPAND

  - GPU support was significantly extended for the current release:
    Added features include preconditioners for CUDAWrappers::SparseMatrix
    objects, support for MPI-parallel CUDA data structures, support for
    constraints in the matrix-free framework (and thus also support for
    adaptively refined meshes).

  - Parallel geometric multigrid (GMG) improvements

    EXPAND

  - Four new tutorial programs (step-61, step-62, step-63, step-64)
    and a new code gallery program

    EXPAND

  - The release contains bug fixes and performance improvements of the
    matrix-free framework and related geometric multigrid solvers. In
    particular, the implementation of the Chebyshev iteration, an often
    used smoother in the matrix-free context, has been revised to reduce
    vector accesses. This speeds up matrix-free multigrid solvers by up to
    10-15% on geometries with affine (parallelogram and parallelpiped)
    cells, and up to 5% on geometries with cells bounded by curved edges
    and faces.

  - Various variants of geometric multigrid solvers and matrix-free
    implementations were run on up to 304,128 cores during the acceptance
    phase of the SuperMUC-NG supercomputer, verifying the scalability of
    our implementations. Some performance bottlenecks on distributed
    triangulation with more than 100k MPI ranks have been fixed.

  - The FE_BernardiRaugel class implements the non-standard
    Bernardi-Raugel element that can be used to construct a stable
    velocity-pressure pair for the Stokes equation. The Bernardi-Raugel
    element is an enriched version of the Q_1^d element with added bubble
    functions on each edge (in 2d) or face (in 3d). It addresses the fact
    that the Q_1^d - Q_0 combination is not inf-sup stable (requiring a
    larger velocity space), and that the Q_2^d - Q_1 combination is
    stable but sub-optimal since the velocity space is too large relative to
    the pressure space to provide additional accuracy commensurate with the
    cost of the large number of velocity unknowns. The Bernardi-Raugel
    space is intermediate to the Q_1^d and Q_2^d spaces.

  - The FE_NedelecSZ class is a new implementation of the Nédélec element
    on quadrilaterals and hexahedra. It overcomes the sign conflict issues
    present in traditional Nédélec elements that arise from the edge
    and face parameterizations used in the basis functions. Therefore, this
    element should provide consistent results for general quadrilateral and
    hexahedral elements for which the relative orientations of edges and
    faces (as seen from all adjacent cells) are often difficult to establish.

  - A new class ParsedConvergenceTable has been introduced. The class
    simplifies the construction of convergence tables, reading the options
    for the generation of the table from a parameter file. It provides a
    series of methods that can be used to compute the error given a
    reference exact solution, or the difference between two numerical
    solutions, or any other custom computation of the error, given via
    std::function objects.

  - A new interface to \texttt{boost::geometry::index::rtree} has been added.

    EXPAND

  - More than 200 other features and bugfixes.
