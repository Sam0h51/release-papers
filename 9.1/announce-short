Version 9.1.0 of deal.II, the object-oriented finite element library awarded
the J. H. Wilkinson Prize for Numerical Software, has been released. It is
available for free under an Open Source license from the deal.II homepage at
https://www.dealii.org/

The major changes of this release are:
  - Improved support for automatic and symbolic differentiation
  - Full support for $hp$ adaptivity in parallel computations
  - Interfaces to the HDF5 file format and libraries
  - Significantly extended GPU support
  - Parallel geometric multigrid (GMG) improvements
  - Four new tutorial programs (step-61, step-62, step-63, step-64)
    and a new code gallery program

The main features of deal.II are:
  - Extensive documentation and 63 working example programs
  - Support for dimension-independent programming
  - Locally refined adaptive meshes and multigrid support
  - A zoo of different finite elements
  - Built-in support for shared memory and distributed parallel computing,
    scaling from laptops to clusters with 100,000+ of processor cores
  - Interfaces to Trilinos, PETSc, METIS, UMFPACK and other external software
